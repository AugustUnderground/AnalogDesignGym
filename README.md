# Analog Design Gym

A collection of [gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments for analog 
integrated circuit design, based on [AC²E](https://github.com/mattschw/ace) /
[HAC²E](https://github.com/AugustUnderground/hace).

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/augustunderground/gym-analog-design.git
```

## Requirements

Creating an environment requires trained NMOS and PMOS models and HAC²E
including all dependencies.

## Getting Started

After installing:

```python
import gym

env = gym.make(             'gym_ad:op2-xh035-v0'   # Only working env right now
              , pdk-path  = '/path/to/tech'         # path to xfab pdk
              , ckt-path  = '/path/to/op2'          # path to testbench
              , nmos-path = '/path/to/models/nmos'  # path to nmos model
              , pmos-path = '/path/to/models/pmos'  # paht to pmos model
              , random-target = False )             # start close to target
```

Where `<nmos|pmos>_path` is the location of the corresponding `model.pt`.

## Environments

### Observation Space

The observation space includes the current perforamnce, the specified target,
the normalized distance between target and current performance (`| t - p | / t`) 
and operating point characteristics for all devices in the circuit.

### Reward

The overall reward `r` is calculated based on individual performance
parameters:

```
r = ∑ ( (tanh(| l |) · m) + (- l² · (1 - m)) )
```

Where `l` is the vector with normalized losses for each performance `p` and
target value `t`

```
    | t - p |
l = ---------
        t
```

and `m` is a mask showing whether the performance was reached, i.e. `p > t`, in
which case `tanh` is applied so the reward doesn't increase infinitely.
Otherwise the loss is squared and negated.
