## Single Ended OpAmp Environments

### Observation Spaces and Technologies

The observation space includes the current perforamnce, the specified target,
the normalized distance between target and current performance (`| t - p | / t`) 
and operating point characteristics for all devices in the circuit.

### Action Spaces and Variants

Action Spaces in `v0` and `v1` are _continuous_ and implemented with
`gym.spaces.Box`. For further details, see the descriptions for specific
environments.

| Variant | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `v0`    | Electrical design space (`gmoverid`, `fug`, ...) |
| `v1`    | Geometric Design Space (`W`, `L`, ...)           |
| `v2`    | TBA                                              |

### Reward

The overall reward `r` is calculated based on individual performance
parameters:

```
r = ∑ ( (tanh(| l |) · m) + (- l² · (1 - m)) )
```

Where `l` is the vector with normalized losses for each performance `p` and
target value `t`

```
    | t - p |
l = ---------
        t
```

and `m` is a mask showing whether the performance was reached, i.e. `p > t`, in
which case `tanh` is applied so the reward doesn't increase infinitely.
Otherwise the loss is squared and negated.
