A collection of [gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments for analog 
integrated circuit design, based on [AC²E](https://github.com/matthschw/ace) /
[HAC²E](https://github.com/AugustUnderground/hace).

### AC²E Backends

It is planned to support _all_ AC²E backends in the future. For now the
following are (partially) implemented.

- [X] X-Fab XH035 350nm as `xh035`
- [ ] X-Fab XH018 180nm as `xh018`
- [ ] X-Fab XT018 180nm as `xt035`
- [X] SkyWater 130nm as `sky130`
- [X] GPDK 180nm as `gpdk180`
- [ ] GPDK 90nm as `gpdk90`
- [ ] PTM 130nm
